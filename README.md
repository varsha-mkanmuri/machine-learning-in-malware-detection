This project reviews the topic of Android Malware Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models. 

Advances in machine learning and AI have led to improved detection of malicious apps in the Android operating system.

This paper performs a literature survey covering the latest advancements in detecting Android Malware using state-of-the-art Machine learning models. We also cover the newest research in Machine Learning in Security, Android Malware Detection techniques, and Explainability in AI.
The papers also include some limitations and possible research directions to improve these Machine Learning models in the future.

As part of the experimental study, we have built machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Ensemble Methods, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Network Models. We use SVM and Random Forests as it has advantages
in solving high-dimensional, non-linear problems.

We also use Ensemble Methods and Neural Networks as they are robust to outliers (lower fault tolerance). We compare different ML models to evaluate performance and find that Neural Networks have the best accuracy and F1 score on test data. 

Finally, we learned through SHAP explainability and feature importance plots that android applications that send or read sms, access device location and use hidden ‘.exe’ files during run time are typically classified as Malware with a high-level of confidence successfully
by our final Neural Network classifier.
